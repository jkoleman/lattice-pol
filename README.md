**LATTICE** (**L**aboratory Data **ATT**ached to **I**oT **C**onnected **E**nvironment) is a scientific decentralized multi-tenant IoT platform.

**LATTICE** will serve as a multipurpose DePIN with these components:

(1) **PRN** (**P**hysical **R**esource **N**etwork) that manages lab devices (microscopes, etc.)

(2) **DRN** (**D**igital **R**esource **N**etwork) that extracts, distributes, and stores data from these devices

(3) **Polygon** integration where participants earn financial rewards and ownership stakes through **POL** tokenized incentives for remote device usage, compute node resources, and data sharing
